# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Overview
This project implements various versions of the Quicksort algorithm and the Natural Merge Sort algorithm in Java. The implementation adheres to constraints, avoiding the use of non-standard libraries such as `Vectors` or `ArrayLists`.

## Files Included
- **Quicksort.java**: Basic Quicksort implementation using the first element as the pivot.
- **QuicksortAdvanced.java**: Advanced Quicksort implementations with different pivot strategies and insertion sort thresholds.
- **NaturalMergeSort.java**: Natural Merge Sort implementation using a linked list structure.

## Java Version and IDE
- **Java Version**: OpenJDK 11
- **IDE Used**: IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1

## Compilation Instructions
To compile the Java files, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
javac Quicksort.java
javac QuicksortAdvanced.java
javac NaturalMergeSort.java
```

## Execution Instructions
To execute the compiled classes, use the following commands:

```bash
java Quicksort
java QuicksortAdvanced
java NaturalMergeSort
```

Make sure the input data files are placed in the correct directory, and the output will be generated in the same directory.

## Input and Output Files
- Input files: All required and student-generated test input files in `.txt` format.
- Output files: Generated by the program and saved as `.txt` files.
